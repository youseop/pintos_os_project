Acceptable output:
  (dir-empty-name) begin
  (dir-empty-name) mkdir "" (must return false)
  (dir-empty-name) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (dir-empty-name) begin
  (dir-empty-name) mkdir "" (must return false)
- (dir-empty-name) end

(Process exit codes are excluded for matching purposes.)
