FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (dir-under-file) begin
  (dir-under-file) create "abc"
  (dir-under-file) mkdir "abc" (must return false)
  (dir-under-file) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (dir-under-file) begin
  (dir-under-file) create "abc"
  (dir-under-file) mkdir "abc" (must return false)
- (dir-under-file) end

(Process exit codes are excluded for matching purposes.)
